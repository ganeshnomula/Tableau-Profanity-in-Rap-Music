# Tableau-Profanity-in-Rap-Music
This project is about visualizing profanity in Rap music with data available from 1985 to 2013

# Introduction
As we all know, a common ingredient in many rap lyrics is shameless profanity. No word is off limits. With f-bombs and assorted slurs streaming through popular music, itâ€™s no shock that some people are up in arms against rap. Is it appropriate for them to be spitting profanity-laced lyrics to the world? 

The present condition of rap music today is something that is talked about in music and cinema industry. Many individuals including myself strongly believe that rap music has been deteriorating slowly since last 10 years. That is because the present rap/hip-hop artists depend exclusively on beat and not on great verses or meaningful lyrics. Which seems to be the loss of creative craftsmanship. In my view, the lyrics supported today have next to zero word play, and the level of vocabulary has been seriously dropped down and improper music language is eventually making it's way to common conversational language.

The dataset I have chosen for the project contains a comprehensive list of 15 most used profane words in different albums and songs by different artists from 1985 to 2013. Dataset has 2297 rows and 19 columns.

The Primary Objective is to extract a story out of the dataset to help music industry to understand about the insane rise of profane lanugage in the songs. I want to leverage opportunity through this class and added with my interest in music to frame an interesting story from this dataset. The story contains descriptive analysis using various statistical visualizations of variables in the dataset. The following table gives metadata.
